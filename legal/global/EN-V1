# Jellyfish Social Legal Agreements

## Our Service
Jellyfish Social is an innovative AI-driven social platform presented as a 2D game-like experience. Users embody jellyfish avatars on a virtual map, exploring themed 'guilds' (communities) tailored to diverse social purposes, such as gaming, professional networking, romantic connections, and intimate relationships. Key features include multi-identity profiles per guild, AI-assisted conversations (e.g., topic starters and moderation), intelligent matching based on user data, a reputation scoring system, and customisable skins unlocked via in-app tokens. In-game billboards display non-intrusive advertisements. We prioritise user privacy in handling personal data like profiles, chats, and locations to foster safe, engaging interactions.

These agreements (effective 18 November 2025) include Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, and End User License Agreement. They comply with PIPL, PDPA, APPI, PIPA, and CCPA/CPRA. Guild supplements appear on registration. By using the service, you agree to all.
